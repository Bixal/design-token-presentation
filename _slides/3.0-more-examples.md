notes: "Our guide aims to address both designers that have an understanding of tokens and the designer who is just learning about what they can do. We created a high level guide to give a base understanding of what, why and how to use tokens for those that are new to it. As well as exercises in CodePen and templates in Figma for those who have more experience using them."
