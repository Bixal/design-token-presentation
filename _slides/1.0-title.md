notes: "Our exploration of design tokens started with having conversations with some designers and developers about their understanding of tokens. We learned that designers are missing an opportunity to utilize this shared language within USWDS that will help them collaborate and implement designs. While many designers are aware of tokens, the available resources are mostly geared towards developers, leaving designers lost unless they have 2-3 months to dedicate to learning the language. Our idea was to create a guide to help designers learn and implement tokens one step at a time. Not to overwhlem them, but instead to gently ease into the process"
