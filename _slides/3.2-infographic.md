notes: "You'll find in the guide some learning tools like a codepen exercise, a figma file that can be duplicated and used for your projects and infographics to help visualize the information. Since we have both designers that understand tokens and designers that are just learning, we included examples and exercises within the guide to be useful for everyone."
